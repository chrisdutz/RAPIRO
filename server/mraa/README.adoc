== MRAA Helper

This module is intended for deploying Maven bundles of the IOTDK libs (AKA MRAA).
You actually only need to run it once and it will download and unpack the latest version
and deploy the artifacts to a remote Maven repository.

In order to do this, you need to

----
mvn deploy -Dremote-repo.url=<url of the repo> -Dremote-repo.id=<id of the repo>
----

After that the Maven artifact mraa should be available:

----
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.intel.iotdk</groupId>
        <artifactId>mraa</artifactId>
        <version>2.0.0</version>
    </dependency>
