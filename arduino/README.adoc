= Arduino development from within IntelliJ

In order to develop, build and deploy the Arduino sketches from withing IntelliJ I had to setup a tool called `platformio`.

   sudo pip install -U platformio

After this I was able to build the Arduino sketch by telling Maven to execute the following command in the `compile` phase of the build:

   platformio run

In order to install the built application on the arduino, I highjacked the `deploy` phase of Maven:

   platformio --target upload

In order to make IntelliJ show me C and C++ syntax highligting, I went to `Preferences.../Editor/File types`, selected `C/C++` and added the extension `*.ino`

Now I was ready to start building and deploying my Arduino sketches from within IntelliJ
